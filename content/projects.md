**FlightAware**  
Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) will soon be required on all commercial airlines. Every community feeder/receiver counts.
I am running my feeder on a setup known as PiAware (Built with a Raspberry Pi).

**DN42**  
Decentralized Network 42 is an overlay network that allows members to establish peering connections and provide transit service as if they were an actual ISP. There is a heavy focus on BGP within the community. This is a place to test ideas on an actual network without bringing down half your continent's internet.

**Cloudflare**  
Cloudflare provides many services from their 1.1.1.1 DNS to a secure web application firewall. If you would like to get started seeing what Cloudflare is about, setup DNS over HTTPS (DoH).

**Hurricane Electric**  
Hurricane Electric is a top tier Internet Service Provider. However, the key thing to point out is they provide IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels for free. They also provide you with a block of IPv6 addresses.

**Pi-Hole**  
Pi-Hole is another Raspberry Pi project. However, it can be run in a VM as well. Pi-Hole is a local DNS server that blocks ads. Combined with Cloudflare's DoH, you get a pretty awesome DNS server.  See my post on this site for more info or visit their website at https://pi-hole.net/

**Storj**  
Storj is an effort to decentralize cloud storage.  
~~I currently have 1 node with 900GB of storage and 1TB of transfer bandwidth allowed per month.~~
